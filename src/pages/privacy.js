      <Typography sx= {{ fontFamily: "monospace"}}>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
